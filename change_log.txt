  Port Scanning has been completely changed for WinNT and above.
    WinNT+ :Ports are not scanned, they are loaded from registry to comport
              combobox in form "4 = \VCP0". Sorted by com number. No longer shows
              scanports form.
              The "scanports" commandline parameter won't be needed now, as
              bluetooth ports don't cause delays
    WinME- :Scanned by opening the same as before.
    Please report any problems especially on old versions of Windows (pre XP eg Win98)

help commandline option errors when port scan is slow.
Binary sync mode
  -doesn't seem to update correctly until after mode changed back to ascii then back to hex
  -perhaps should be active in ascii, but not ansi
  -and masking doesn't seem to work right. Check. Correct or improve explanation
Freeze button no longer working. (works in 1.99.16). Code unchanged. (bug in APRO)
Reported RS485 problems. Not checked, but is a known windows bug due to slow RTS timing (see apro forums)

------------------------------------------
Not really faults
------------------------------------------
showallemulator shows BS as triangle (no: ^H doesn't send BS)

-----------------
ToDo .... maybe
-----------------

  As it has been commented out for reasons forgotten, I am a bit loathe to restore it.

--------------------------
Feature Requests
--------------------------
Spy mode capture file
Resize changes rows/cols
It would very useful to add command line options for font and font size choose on program start.

It would be nice if the sync chars would allow random length "Data Frames" when set to "Single", without the data frame size speifically set. I.E. header byte set to
AND $80 (MSB set) and variable length messages to
follow.

Delay on repeats of the Send comboboxes
Key for Break and for ^C
handle - and -- in commandline arguments ie -scanports=2
fix scanports to abort properly or to run in background, and to display dialog after mainform is visible.
Send multiple files from command line
Delays for other send options and normal terminal


A "sync feature" that will allow closing and re-opening the capture files with an incremented name.
The plot files from the scope are HPGL and have a known ending sequence.  So it
would be nice to start the capture, and wait for the stream to come from the
, including its termination set, then close the current capture file, and start
a new one automatically.  Later I can go in and print out the capture files directly.
This would make Realterm a standalone, rather than embedding it in a second pgm.
